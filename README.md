# Predicting-Late-Delivery-Risks
The goal of this project is to analyze and optimize the delivery chain
by identifying the key factors contributing to late deliveries, both
before and after incorporating shipment details,leading to more
accurate predictions and improved operational efficiency.

Business Insights:

In our project, the initial model performance for predicting
late_delivery_risk was at 70% accuracy. However, after incorporating
shipment-related features—such as diff_hours and ship_hour—the
model's predictive accuracy significantly improved, boosting to 90%.
This highlights the critical role of optimizing the time difference between
order and shipment. By fine-tuning these factors, we can significantly
reduce the risk of late deliveries, ultimately improving operational
efficiency and customer satisfaction.
